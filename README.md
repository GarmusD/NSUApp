# NSUApp
Here is a code for Windows and Android applications. Some code is shared with NSUWatcher also.

## Android
Android app is mostly "watching" app. It means it's not possible to make "deep" NSU system setup.

## Windows
An app for Windows Desktop is most advanced software, allowing to create NSU setup, like register temperature sensors, create comfort zones, assign circullation pumps, change working parameters of the NSU systems and so on.
